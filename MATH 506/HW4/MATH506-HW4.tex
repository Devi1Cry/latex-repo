\begin{problem}[1]
  Let $X$ be a real linear space, $p$ a sublinear functional on $X$, $Y$ a subspace of $X$, and $f_{0}$ a linear functional on $Y$ such that $f_{0} \leq p(x)$ for all $x \in Y$.
Then there exists a linear functional $f$ on $X$ such that $f(x) \leq p(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $f|_{Y} = f_{0}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Here for all $x,y \in X$ and $a \geq 0$, $\func{p}{X}{\R}$ satisfies \[p(x+y) \leq p(x) + p(y) \qquad \text{and} \qquad p(ax) = ap(x).\]
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $E$ be the set of all linear extensions $g$ of $f_{0}$ with
    $g(x) \leq p(x)$, with $E \neq \emptyset$, since $f_{0} \in E$.
    If we define an ordering on $E$ where $g \leq h$ means $h$ is an
    extension of $g$, then for each $C \subset E$, we can define $\hat{g}(x) = g(x)$ if $x\in \mathscr{D}(g)$ for $g \in C$, which is a linear functional with $\mathscr{D}(\hat{g}) = \bigcup_{g\in C}\mathscr{D}(g)$.  
Then, we have $g \leq \hat{g}$ for all $g \in C$, and since $C$ was arbitrary, Zorn's lemma allows us to choose an maximal element of $E$, which we will call $f$.  
By definition of $E$, we also have $f(x) \leq p(x)$.

Now, we must show that $\mathscr{D}(f) = X$. Suppose this is not true.  
Then, we can pick a $y_{1} \in X\setminus\mathscr{D}(f)$ and consider the subspace $Y_{1}$, where any $x \in Y_{1}$ can be written $x=y + \alpha y_{1}$ and define a functional $g_{1}$ on $Y_{1}$ by $g_{1}(y + \alpha y_{1}) = f(y) + \alpha c$, where $c \in \R$. 
By this then, we have $f(x) \leq g_{1}(x)$, thus contradicting the maximality of $f$. 

(Note: this is the Hahn-Banach Theorem as appearing in the book.)
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}[2]
  Let $X$ be a real linear space and $A,B \subset X$ be nonempty, disjoint, convex subsets.
  If $A$ is also open, then there exists $f \in X^{*}$ and $a \in \R$ such that \[f(x) < a < f(y), \qquad x \in A, y \in B.\]
  
  Hint: for $C = z_{0} + A - B \coloneqq \set{z_{0} + x - y : x \in A, y \in B}$, define Minkowski functional of $C$ by $p_{C}(x) = \inf \set{\alpha > 0 : \alpha^{-1}x \in C}$, for all $x \in X$.
    The result is a sublinear functional on $X$ with $C = \set{x : p_{C}(x) < 1}$, and that there exists $c > 0$ such that $0 \leq p_{C}(x) \geq c\norm{x}$. 
    You do not have to prove these two facts.

\begin{problem}[3]
  Explain that the completeness of $X$ in Theorem 6.5.11 (principle of uniform boundedness) cannot be removed.

  Hint: For example, consider $X = \set{x = (x_{n}) \in \ell^{2} : x_{n} \neq 0 \text{ for only finite many } n}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[4]
  Let $\func{T}{X}{Y}$ be a bounded linear operator, where $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces.  
  If $T$ is bijective, then there are two constants $a,b > 0$ such that $a\norm{x} \leq \norm{Tx} \leq b\norm{x}$, where $\norm{x}$ and $\norm{Tx}$ stand for the norms on $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[5]
  Let $X = C\brk{0}{1}$ with sup-norm and $Y$ be the subspace of functions $x \in X$ which have a continuous derivative.
  Define $\func{T}{Y}{X}$ by $Tx = x'$, where the prime denotes differentiation.
  Then $T$ is closed in the sense that its graph is closed.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[6]
  Suppose that $S = \set{s_{\alpha} : \alpha \in A}$ is a set of points in $X$ such that $\overline{\Span}\set{S} = X$.
  If $\set{f_{n}}$ is a bounded sequence in $X^{*}$ and $\set{f_{n}(s_{\alpha})}$ converges for all $\alpha \in A$, then there exists $f \in X^{*}$ such that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_{n}(x) = f(x)$ for all $x\in X$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[7]
  Let $X$ be a finite-dimensional space, then for sequences $\set{x_{n}} \subset X$ and $\set{f_{n}^{*}} \subset X^{*}$, if there exist $x \in X$ and $f \in X^{*}$ such that $x_{n} \rightharpoonup x$ and $f_{n} \xrightharpoonup{*} f$, then we have $x_{n} \to x$ and $f_{n} \to f$.
